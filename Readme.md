// README
// eescalc.js v1.0 by D
//
// The main purpose of this program is to provide users guidance on whether or not they should
// Use sfp at 8sf, dont use spf at 8sf, if one has enough ees or aees to go to x sf, for ex.
// Simulation-based estimation/calculation of avg. number of ees it takes to go from a to b

// Takes in 3 or 4 parameters, start ees, end ees, number of simulations, and desired sfps
// If no sfp parameter is given, default will be 0, 5 and 10

// Note that no range is given in the code, but ees can range widely from:
// min: 11 ees to avg: 33 ees to high: 55 ees for sfp 0-11 as an example.

// v1.0 by D on October 8, 2022.
